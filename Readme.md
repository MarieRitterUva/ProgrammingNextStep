## SADE - Simulating Addiction with Difference Equations

This is a program that was developed by Marie Ritter on the basis of a paper by Grasman, Grasman, and van der Maas (submitted for revision). The program implements the model proposed in this paper and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the program. From input parameters the program simulates the progress of addiction and creates graphs over time as well as a bifurcation diagram (in development). Furthermore, the program provides the option to estimate how successful a therapy might be when entering parameters for both the therapy time as well as the time afterwards under the tab _Therapy Success_ (in development).  
Lastly, users can download the produced data file from the last simulation in order to inspect it further.

#### Development Circumstances

This is a program created under supervision from Professor Han van der Maas and Claire Stevenson for the course "Programming: The next step" at the Universiteit van Amsterdam in Spring 2016. 


#### Further information

Further information on the model can be obtained from the paper by Grasman, Grasman, and van der Maas (submitted for revision).   Further information on the program can be obtained fromt the developer: [E-mail](marie.ritter@student.uva.nl).
