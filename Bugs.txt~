- For loop in SimulateAddictionComponents() stops after executing the first few steps of the equation
SOLVED: Took global assignment out of For loop, extra in function (possibly there is a smarter way?) --> works now

NOTE: There is still a set.seed(1) in SimulateAddictionComponents()
SOLVED: Taken out

- For loop doesn't loop in server.R
SOLVED: simple assignment problem

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- For some reason C settles on one parameter only after a few trials - only one equilibrium not 2!!!

At the moment only one function for all Graphs
!! Problem: Can Shiny take multiple graphs? If not, need to be saved somewhere (png --> Can Shiny save and access)
!! Maybe better to have separate functions for speed?
SOLVED: Have option to display only one graphs (also interface is less crowded), 
NOTE : but possibility to save graphs???

NOTE: At the moment only CalculateParameters and InitializeVectors have default parameters, possibly a problem; possibly set defaults in GUI NOT in program
SOLVED: defaults in GUI now
NOTE: also works for Display Logic?

NOTE: Program only suitable for alcohol addiction at the moment (Nicotine could be added later quite easily)

NOTE: There needs to be an error when a person wants to see successful/fail graphs where there aren't any

NOTE: Say in GUI that program shows one simulation (the first success/fail simulation) --> if others wanted data can be downloaded and code to make graphs can be downloaded

---------------------------------------------------------

- Bifurcation diagrams (simulate many times (burn first samples) -> Plot (like RLABS video YouTube)
  --> Possibly make different tab for Bifurcation diagrams (start with E as bifurcation parameter, possibility to use another parameter)
