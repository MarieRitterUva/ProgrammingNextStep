- For loop in SimulateAddictionComponents() stops after executing the first few steps of the equation
----> Took global assignment out of For loop, extra in function (possibly there is a smarter way?) --> works now

At the moment only one function for all Graphs
!! Problem: Can Shiny take multiple graphs? If not, need to be saved somewher (png --> Can Shiny save and access)
!! Maybe better to have separate functions for speed?

NOTE: There is still a set.seed(1) in SimulateAddictionComponents()
!!!! Please take out after testing phases

NOTE: Program only suitable for alcohol addiction at the moment (Nicotine could be added later quite easily)
