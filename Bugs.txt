- For loop in SimulateAddictionComponents() stops after executing the first few steps of the equation
----> Took global assignment out of For loop, extra in function (possibly there is a smarter way?) --> works now

NOTE: There is still a set.seed(1) in SimulateAddictionComponents()
!!!! Please take out after testing phases
